# java-paint-server
A drawing app that I developed with Java, for the purpose of study. With it you can draw circles, squares, rectangles, you can paint them, change their fill color, save that drawing and load it.

It also has client-server communication through sockets, so you can save your drawing in the server and load it from another client.
